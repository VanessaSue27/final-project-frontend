            Sofia has experience working as a neonatal ICU nurse where she used to
            write daily log books for premature babies who did not end up
            immediately under their parents&apos; care. Depending on the situation,
            it can sometimes take a couple of hours or even days before the parents
            can visit them. A lot can happen in that time frame, good and bad, so
            memory making and data recording is important and crucial.

            This log book was like a &quot;time capsule&quot; that parents could
            then carry on and give to that little person when they grow up, and a
            handy way for them to record important data around the baby&apos;s
            growing years.

            Originally this was done in paper format. Our idea was to take this to
            the next level and create a web app that every parent can use to log on
            details about their child, from birth until they are toddlers: a digital
            &quot;time capsule&quot;. Digitalizing this concept makes it possible to
            log, not only measurements, but also reflections about specific days and
            even milestones.
